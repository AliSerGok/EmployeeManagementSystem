#### The file contains SQL codes (SQL file)(EmployeeManagementSystem/spring-mvc-security-jdbc/spring-mvc-security-jdbc/sql-scripts).
#### SQL codes will create three different tables named 'employee', 'members', 'roles'.
#### Each member in the 'members' table can have at least one of the roles 'employee', 'manager' and 'admin'.
# !!! USER NAMES ARE MEMBER NAMES AND THEIR PASSWORD IS 'fun123' !!!

#### Members with the 'manager' role can click on a button to go to the 'leaders' page after logging in. They can see the employee list by clicking the button named "Show Employee List" on the 'leaders' page. Members with the 'Manager' role do not have the authority to delete, update and add 'employees'. They cannot access the links where these operations are performed.
